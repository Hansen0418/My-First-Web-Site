HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:<br>
Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. <br>
Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. <br>
Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.<br><br>
It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard.<br>
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.<br>
This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript.<br>
